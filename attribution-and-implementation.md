This site uses the Jekyll Computer Modern Theme. It is a simple theme for publishing essays to GitHub Pages with Jekyll: [Github Link](https://github.com/kortina/jekyll-computer-modern-theme). It is ðŸ†— for a simple blog or academic paper.

## $$LaTex$$ Markup
For MathJax the following code has to be included in the page header:

```html
<script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
  MathJax.Hub.Config({
   CommonHTML: {
    scale: 85
   }
  });
</script>
<script type="text/javascript" async src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML">
</script>
```
### Scaling
The parameter `scale` above determines how big the $$LaTex$$ formulas are relative to the regular text. I found by trial and error that 85 is pretty close to a 1:1-ratio, as seen in the F$$Formula$$a. However, this is only true for a computer screen. On my mobile the ratio changes. 

### Delimiters
In $$LaTeX$$ code like this `\( \nabla_\boldsymbol{x} J(\boldsymbol{x}) \)` the markdown syntax uses `$$...$$` in stead of `\(...\)` as the delimiter: `$$ \nabla_\boldsymbol{x} J(\boldsymbol{x}) $$`.
and the code is rendered as $$ \nabla_\boldsymbol{x} J(\boldsymbol{x}) $$.

Formulas that are their own paragraph, in $$LaTex$$ delimited as `\[...\]` have to be delimited by <p>$$...$$</p>, otherwise the unrendered code will be repeated after the formula:

$$ \nabla_\boldsymbol{x} J(\boldsymbol{x}) $$

With the tags the superflous raw code disapears:

<p>$$ \nabla_\boldsymbol{x} J(\boldsymbol{x}) $$</p>

For some reason I have not figured out yet, this is caused by some combination a MathJax and the theme. I have tested this in other themes and there the <p> tags are not necessary.

## Style Guide

Here is a short paragraph of text.

> Here is what a blockquote would look like. Here is what a blockquote would look like.

<a name="lorem"></a>

Here's a list with 3 items:

- item numero
- second item, this one is long enough so that it will wrap onto another line of text so you can see how it aligns
- third item

A horizontal rule:

---

And here is a code block:

```python
some_int = 11
some_list = [12]
some_list.append(some_int)
print(f"Some python code {some_list}")
```

All the headings:

# h1 example

text.

## h2 example

text.

### h3 example

text.


text.

##### h5 example

text.

###### h6 example

text.

And an aside:

<aside markdown="1">
Some markdown aside (with support for `markdown`)
</aside>

An image (from _Nightcrawler_) resized to same width as everything else (the default):

A full width image (from _Ghost in the Shell_) (using `<img class="full-width" ... />` via the `_includes/embed.html` helper):

{% include embed.html class="full-width" url="https://kortina.nyc/files/conscioussness-as-computation/ghost-in-the-shell-contructing-the-mind.jpg" %}

A vimeo embed (also via the `_includes/embed.html` helper):

{% include embed.html url="https://player.vimeo.com/video/389644389" autoplay="0" %}
